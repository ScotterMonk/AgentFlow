## Grammar
- Appropriate punctuation at line ends.
- Markdown:
    - Use back-ticks liberally, brackets rarely, line numbers never, and resist redundancy as you see here:
        [`app.py`](app.py) --> `app.py`.
        [`@\.env`](.env) --> `@\.env`.
        [`do()`](app.py:54) --> `do()` (app.py).
    - With numbered subheads, remove "#":
        "## 1) Setup" --> "1) Setup"
        "### 1) Setup" --> "1) Setup"
    - No double-asterisks:
        "**Impact**:" --> "Impact:"

## Write a document
Based on the user query (research question), open a new .md document named based on user query topic.
Open this empty document in main code window for user to easily view and [later] edit.

Write in this order:
1) Objective Summary
Write one strictly objective paragraph (4-6 sentences) covering: research question, methods, key results, limitations, and conclusions.

2) Dual Interpretation
Create two 4-sentence takes on the findings, each with a brief title:
- Skeptical View – spotlight flaws/risks.
- Supportive View – spotlight benefits.

3) Evidence Search & Validation
For each view:
- Search sources → 3 peer reviewed sites, 2 “alternative” sites, plus: `Resource sites`.
For every source, list:
- URL & outlet
- Key claim/supporting point
- Credibility rating
- Conflicts of interest (if any)

4) Conflict of Interest Table
Identify COIs for the original study and all web sources. Use:
| Entity | Interest | Possible Bias | Impact (High/Med/Low) |
Important to thoroughly investigate and document potential conflicts of interest found in:
	-- The original study (funding sources, author affiliations, disclosures)
	-- Supporting evidence sources (who funds the research or websites)
	-- Critical evidence sources (who funds the research or websites)
	-- Industry relationships that might influence interpretations
	-- Political or ideological factors that might bias conclusions
Note: Government entities can be biased for various reasons, including donations and other support received from industry leaders. This includes but is not limited to regulatory capture.

5) Evidence Quality Checklist
Score the study and each source on: design, statistics, peer review, replication, consensus fit, evidence level.

6) Integrated Truth Assessment
Briefly state:
- Well supported claims
- Weak/low quality claims
- Major disagreements
- Unknowns/gaps
- Stakeholder incentives

7) Balanced Conclusion
Give a concise, nuanced verdict that:
- Weighs evidence quality
- Recognizes both interpretations
- Flags context limits
- Assigns confidence levels
- Recommends next research steps
