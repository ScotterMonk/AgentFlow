## Create a markdown document
This document will serve multiple purposes:
- Reminder of user query (research question).
- Evolving `plan document`.
- Log of progress.

Follow these directions carefully:
1) Based on the user query:
- Create a `short name` for the `plan` (research project) that uses dashes instead of spaces.
- Create a `plan document`: new markdown document named `@\.roo\docs\plans\plan_[timestamp]_[short name].md`.
- Feature the user query at the top.
2) Open this empty document in main code window for user to easily view and edit at any time.

## Research
Write in this order:
1) Objective Summary
Write one strictly objective paragraph (4-6 sentences) covering:
- Research question.
- Methods.
- Key results.
- Limitations.
- Conclusions.
Update `plan document`.
2) Dual Interpretation
Create two 4-sentence takes on the findings, each with a brief title:
- Skeptical View – spotlight flaws/risks.
- Supportive View – spotlight benefits.
Update `plan document`.
3) Evidence Search & Validation
For each view:
- Search sources → 3 peer reviewed sites, 2 “alternative” sites, plus: `Resource sites`.
For every source, list:
- URL & outlet.
- Key claim/supporting point.
- Credibility rating.
- Conflicts of interest (if any).
- Prefer recenct sources, beginning with current month.
    - If few or no results in current month: Try last 6 months.
        - If few or no results in last 6 months: Try last 12 months.
            - If few or no results in last 12 months: Try last 24 months.
                - If few or no results in last 24 months: Try last 36 months.
                    - and so on.
- Cite sources.
Update `plan document`.
4) Conflict of Interest Table
Identify COIs for the original study and all web sources. Use:
| Entity | Interest | Possible Bias | Impact (High/Med/Low) |
Important to thoroughly investigate and document potential conflicts of interest found in:
	-- The original study (funding sources, author affiliations, disclosures)
	-- Supporting evidence sources (who funds the research or websites)
	-- Critical evidence sources (who funds the research or websites)
	-- Industry relationships that might influence interpretations
	-- Political or ideological factors that might bias conclusions
Note: Government entities can be biased for various reasons, including donations and other support received from industry leaders. This includes but is not limited to regulatory capture.
Update `plan document`.
5) Evidence Quality Checklist
Score the study and each source on:
- Design.
- Statistics.
- Peer review.
- Replication.
- Consensus fit.
- Evidence level.
Update `plan document`.
6) Integrated Truth Assessment
Briefly state:
- Well supported claims.
- Weak/low quality claims.
- Major disagreements.
- Unknowns/gaps.
- Stakeholder incentives.
Update `plan document`.
7) Balanced Conclusion
Give a concise, nuanced verdict that:
- Weighs evidence quality
- Recognizes both interpretations
- Flags context limits
- Assigns confidence levels
- Recommends next research steps
Update `plan document`.
8) Open `plan document` in a VS Code editor tab for user to see.
