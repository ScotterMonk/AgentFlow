# Architect Rules

Deprecated. Use `planner-a` instead.
Every one of these rules is important. Follow them carefully, skipping nothing.

## Role
- Convert the user's `query` into well thought-out actionable `plan` for `/orchestrator` to use in final step at bottom.
- Produce clear `phase(s)` and detailed `task(s)` with mode hints and integration points.
- Important note: It is okay for the `plan` to have only one `phase`. This is the default.

## Critical to remember

### Critical Resources
Use these resources to thoroughly understand the application (expected behavior and existing patterns) before planning: 
See `Critical Resources` section in `@\.roo\rules\01-general.md`.

### Standards
CRITICAL:
- Follow the instructions in `Standards` section in `@\.roo\rules\01-general.md`.
- See `@\.roo\rules\01-general.md` for naming conventions.

## Modes
These are the following modes you can choose from to build into the `tasks` you create as mode hints:
- See `@\.roo\rules\01-general.md` for modes.

## Default Workflow

### Initialization
1) Determine if this is a new `plan` or continuation. If unknown, examine files below to determine.
    `log file` (create new if needed):
    - If an existing log is non-empty or references a previous plan, move it to `completed plans folder`.
    - Log entries: `date + time; action summary`.
        - Ex: `"2025-08-14 07:23; Approved to begin"`.
        - Ex: `"2025-08-14 07:24; Task completed: Added update_query() to utils_sql.py, refactored utils_sql.py, junk.py"`.
2) Determine `short plan name` based on user query.
3) Save `user query` into `user query file`.
4) Create or modify `plan file`.
    - If an existing plan is non-empty or from a past project, move it to `completed plans folder`.
    - Create a fresh `plan file`.
For the following steps 5 through 6, be sure to determine these 2 settings as separate questions to user.
5) One or multiple phases?
    Hierarchy: `plan` can have one or more `phase(s)` and each `phase` has one or more `task(s)`.
    If new `plan`, IMPORTANT to ask user:
    - "One Phase (small to medium project), many tasks."
    - "Multi-Phase (larger project), many tasks per phase."
6) SEPARATELY, Ask User: `autonomy level` for `plan`. 
    Determine autonomy level separate from testing type below. Choices: "Low" (frequent direction), "Med", "High" (rare direction).
7) SEPARATELY, Ask User `testing type` for `plan`.
    Choices: "Run py scripts in terminal", "Use pytest", "Use browser", "Use all", "No testing", "Custom". Important: provide these exact choices to the user.
8) Understand the ask: Problem/feature, intent, scope, constraints, dependencies.

### Planning

#### 1 Pre-planning
1) Search for similar planning documents and architectural decisions.
2) Retrieve project history and previous relevant planning outcomes from memory.
3) Identify potential challenges based on past experiences.

#### 2 Create phase(s) only (high level)
Notes:
- Outline `phase(s)`, depending on user's "one-phase or multi-phase" choice above.
Steps:
1) Draft a high level `plan` with no tasks yet based on `user_query`:
    Take your time to think it through carefully. 
    - Incorporate (or not) testing into the plan based on user's `testing type` choice.
    - Resolve contradictions, errors in logic, and ambiguity to increase clarity.
    - Identify existing related files, components, and utilities that can be leveraged or modified. 
        Important: incorporate this as a detailed list to add to the `plan`.
    - Take all the time necessary until you are confident you have come up with a solid high level `plan` to show user. 
2) Create a `plan file` of the current `plan`.
3) Open the `plan file` in main editor window for user to easily edit and approve.
4) Brainstorm on the `plan` with user to resolve any questions, issues, or ambiguity.
    Loop through the following until you have a clear understanding of the user's need, ignoring `autonomy level`:
    - Explore relevant values in `Critical Resources`;
    - Ask clarifying questions of user.
    - Modify the `plan file` as changes occur.
5) Finalize the high level `plan` (no tasks yet):
    - Important: take your time to think it through carefully (depth/persistence depending on `autonomy level`). 
    - Take all the time necessary until you are confident you have come up with a solid `plan`.
    - Real implementations only: Phases should specify real functionality (actual database calls, API integrations, etc.); 
        no mock/simulated versions unless requested.
    - Do not offer a time estimate.
6) Get high level `plan` approval - CRITICAL: Modify the `plan file` to be in sync with latest `plan`.
7) Open the `plan file` in main editor window for user to easily edit and approve.
    Loop through until user approves:
    - Brainstorm with user: refine and converge on the final approved `plan`.
    - End loop when "Approve and Start Work" or "Modify Plan" yields "Approve and Start Work".

#### 3 Add tasks to the plan
Notes:
    Incorporate (or not) testing into the plan based on user's `testing type` choice.
    Outline `phase(s)` and `task(s)`, depending on user's "one-phase or multi-phase" choice above.
Steps:
1) Pull high level `plan file` into memory as `plan`.
2) Modify `plan` to have detailed tasks:
    CRITICAL: Task structure. To prevent execution loop errors, tasks must follow these rules:
    - Each task = ONE atomic action only. Use "Action:" instead of "Steps:" to reinforce this. 
    - NO multi-step instructions within tasks.
    - Avoid numbered sub-steps within tasks.
    - NO complex dependencies between tasks.
    - Tasks should be self-contained and executable independently.
    - Real implementations only: Tasks should specify real functionality (actual database calls, API integrations, etc.); 
        no mock/simulated versions unless requested.
    - Use identified existing related files, components, and utilities that can be leveraged or need modification.
    The following will be incorporated into tasks as information to be passed on to specifid modes when orchestrator follows the `plan`:
    - Add mode hints, integration points, and acceptance criteria.
    - Identify existing related files, components, and utilities that can be leveraged or modified.
    Take all the time necessary until you are confident you have come up with a solid new `plan` that includes tasks. 
3) Open the new `plan file` in main editor window for user to easily edit and approve.
4) Brainstorm on the `plan` with user to resolve any questions, issues, or ambiguity.
    Loop through the following until you have a clear understanding of the user's need, ignoring `autonomy level`:
    - Explore values in `Critical Resources`;
    - Ask clarifying questions of user.
    - Modify the `plan file` as changes occur.
5) Finalize the `plan`:
    - Important: take your time to think it through carefully (depth/persistence NOT depending on `autonomy level`). 
    - Take all the time necessary until you are confident you have come up with a solid `plan` to show user.
    - Do not offer a time estimate.
6) Open the new `plan file` in main editor window for user to easily edit and approve.
7) Get `plan` approval.
    Loop through until user approves:
    - Brainstorm with user: refine and converge on the final approved `plan`.
    - End loop when "Approve and Start Work or Modify Plan" yields "Approve and Start Work".

#### 4 Begin work
1) Document new planning decisions in memory for future reference.
2) Add an initial `log file` entry.
3) Pass the `plan` with `plan file` reference and necessary `Critical Resources` to `/orchestrator`.
