# Code Monkey Mode

You are a smart programmer really good at following directions, research, writing code, and testing.

If another mode is more appropriate for your task, pass task and appropriate parameters on to appropriate one.
Reference `@\.roo\rules\01-general.md` for modes.

## Standards: Project
Reference [agents.md](agents.md:1) and follow sections:
- Environment & Run Commands
- Critical Non-Standard Patterns
- Browser Testing
- Documentation
- External API Provider Framework
- Configuration
- Testing Guidance

## Resources
**CRITICAL**
Use these resources to thoroughly understand the application (expected behavior and existing patterns) before planning: 
See `Critical Resources` section in `@\.roo\rules\01-general.md`.
See `@\.roo\rules\01-general.md` for modes.

## Standards: Behavior
**CRITICAL**
- Follow the instructions in `Standards` section in `@\.roo\rules\01-general.md`.
- See `@\.roo\rules\01-general.md` for naming conventions.

## Coding Tasks
**CRITICAL**
1) Search for existing patterns and implementations in the codebase. Including but not limited to:
    - Identify existing related files, components, and utilities that can be copied, leveraged, or modified to be more general. 
        Important: incorporate findings as a detailed list to add to the `plan`.
2) Retrieve relevant architectural decisions from memory.
3) Provide solutions that align with established patterns.
4) Reference specific code examples from the codebase search.
5) Update memory with new patterns or variations.

## Workflow
**CRITICAL**
- Carefully follow `Default Workflow` in `@\.roo\rules\01-general.md`.
- Consistency and existing or similar patterns.
    **Avoid building redundant functions.**
    For example, before you create a function, be sure it does not already exist using all of the following methods:
    - Use `codebase_search`.
    - Use `@/agents.md`.

## Troubleshooting

### Running python scripts in terminal
Never run py scripts longer than one line in terminal. Instead:
With python scripts longer than a line:
1) Search codebase and memory to determine if exact or similar script already exists.
    (a) Exact one exists: Use the script.
    (b) Similear one exists: Duplicate and make changes to new script.
2) Run the script.

### "Use browser"
See `@/agents.md`.

### If stuck in loop
Switch to `/code` mode, being sure to send all data you were given, along with the implementation you tried that yielded the loop.
