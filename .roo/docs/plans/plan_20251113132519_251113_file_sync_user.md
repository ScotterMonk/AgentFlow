# User Query - File Sync Utility

Let's build a simple python utility. The goal is to be able to distribute changed files that have been updated in one project to one or many other projects that have duplicates of those files (that are not as recent), so that all projects can be easily kept up to date.

Some detail: The user will be shown a 800x480 (put this in config.txt file so user can change this) screen that has a title "Agentflow File Sync", description "Use this utility to sync up all your AgentFlow files across as many projects as you want. Most recent 'date modified' will be used as source." 

Below description: 

A "Browse" button. User presses this to be shown a folder structure where they can browse and select a folder. The folder path is then shown in a scrollable grid with an "x" on the right of it, in case user wishes to remove that source. They can press the "Browse" button again to add another that folder, adding as many folders as they wish.

At the very bottom is a "Sync" button. Build the functionality so that when user clicks this button, the comparison and overwrite of newest-to-oldest files begins. Progress is shown via live changes to each row in the grid mentioned above.

Build as modular as possible, so it will be easy to modify and even add new features later. Build into the folder that is the root of this project, eg "D:\Dropbox\Projects\AgentFlow"
